### **Medical Drone Delivery: 2018**

Since hobby drones made it to the mainstream in the 2010s, people have envisioned high-tech skies with FedEx to Amazon to Dominos Pizza deliverying goods and services at the press of the button.  Yet, the majority of ideas were misaligned with existing technology, governement regulations, and impractical use cases.

However, my team and I identified one key point that the media and many test pilots were missing: **Most people don't care how their goods get there.**  People care about timeliness, security, and cost, and could care less that their toothpaste arrived in a carbon-fiber drone. Thus, we set out to solve last-mile delivery in a useful, efficient fashion.

Below is a pitch of our idea. A one-page business outline is found [here](../images/drone-delivery/Astral_QBP.pdf), and a detailed business plan with technical goals is found [here](../images/drone-delivery/AstralAutomationBusinessPlan.pdf).
