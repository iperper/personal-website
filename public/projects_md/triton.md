## Triton

Triton is a system that responds to real-time weather conditions and prevents pipe burst due to freezing in temperatures down to -40F.  Triton was part of the 2.009 MIT MechE capstone course on product design, where I worked with 18 teammates to ideate, design and create an alpha prototype of a product by the end of the semester.  I served as the team yoda to keep everyone sailing along, resolving any team conflicts and working with team leaders to conduct meetings and schedules well.  Luckily, my team made that job easy for me, and we had tremendous success with our product.

**I'm currently working on patent protection for the design, and will release more photos when that's done.**
