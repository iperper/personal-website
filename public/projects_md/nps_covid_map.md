## National Park Closures due to COVID

I had been planning a summer backpacking trip for a while, but with the recent turn of events, these plans aren't looking as certain.  I had heard the many national parks had closed, but I wasn't sure whether they were just closing services and facilities, or actually closing to visitors.  Instead of trying to sort out all the places I could still go manually, Margaret and I built a map to see which parks we could still travel too. 

Red means everything is likely closed, yellow means status is uncertain (some parts might be open), green means the park seems to be open to visitors! 

Sadly, the results don't look too promising.
